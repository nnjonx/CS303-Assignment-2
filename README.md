# CS303-Assignment-2 (and modified assignment 1)
Johnny Nguyen

To run the modified assignment 1 code, place the CS-303 Assignment 1.cpp, dataArray.cpp, and dataArray.h into a compiler, then have a .txt file in the same location as the files so that the code can find it and use it.

Here is an example of an output with the modified assignment 1 code: ![part 1 screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113650373/196512517-86ea8d40-40f1-44d1-98f7-cb4fc3d20751.png)



To run the assignment 2 code: 
Place the CS-303 Assignment 2.cpp, and Business.h into a compiler, then run it. If desired, inside the cpp file contains instructions on modifying values to your liking to get your own results.
